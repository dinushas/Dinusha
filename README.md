Test 01

 

1.      a) We need to check whether all the values are displayed properly for base currency and target currency with respect to the database.

 

b) In DB we need to write query in the currency table like select distinct (currency_name) from currency and the count should match with the drop-down count.

 

c) Then we need to check after giving the amount and the conversion rate the value is converted properly and saved in database. Whatever value will be stored in DB the calculation will be based on that.

We need to check value is matching with DB or nor.

 

2.      Functional test to check the basic add, edit, delete functionality.
